        <p>
            Hi, I am Jose! I live in Makati and things are fine around here. I noticed that the quarantine period has
            been
            speeding up time. We're already more than half-way through in concluding this year. I can't believe it too!

            I took computer science as my course because building and engineering software is one of my passions. I
            would
            love
            to build a tech solution that would a lot of people in their day-to-day life. I think through software, we
            can
            reach
            and change lives of many people in today's digital age.

            I had the taste of programming when I was a grade 7 student. I wanted to add my own content to a game called
            Minecraft. To add my own game content, I had to learn modding through Java programming. I followed through
            YouTube
            tutorials and it was a painful process; knowing that I did not have the foundational knowledge for Java back
            then. I
            stepped back from modding and had to learn everything... starting with the basic "Hello, World!" After that,
            I
            improved significantly and jumped to indie game development with my friends. I was usually the programmer
            then
            my
            friends were the ones making graphical assets. Programming is indeed a fun skill to learn. I am able to
            create
            my
            ideas from scratch. With this and until then, my interest for programming continued and strived.

            I am an enthusiastic person. I like engaging with people and hearing out their ideas. I love being
            optimistic;
            especially with today's pandemic period. Better days will indeed come. As long as we're alive, there is
            always a
            chance to see goodness prevail. I also like music; especially OPM. With that, I play ukulele and guitar.

            I expect this subject to be fun and interactive! I would love to learn about what makes a user interface and
            experience good. I am studying fullstack development amidst the quarantine period. Observingly, I like
            back-end
            development more than front-end. But, it would nice to learn more about how to properly design front-end.
            With
            that,
            I am excited to pick up some new skills from this subject.</p>
